# CAM Async Connector User Guide

`CAMAsyncAFDConnector` is the Ascend CAM-backed asynchronous connector for AFD
Attention/FFN disaggregation. It lets Attention workers compute MoE routing and
exchange routed and shared-expert activations with independent FFN expert ranks
through CAM async dispatch/combine operators.

This guide describes the supported deployment shape, configuration contract,
rank mapping, data flow, startup requirements, and current limitations. The
[DeepSeek-V3.2 recipe](../../recipe/npu/CAMAsyncAFDConnector/deepseek_v3_2/README.md)
contains the historical multi-node launch commands and measurements.

> [!WARNING]
> The current vLLM 0.23 source port has not revalidated CAM async. The linked PCP8 recipe and
> its measurements were produced with the former vLLM/vLLM-Ascend 0.19.1
> environment. Those commands are retained as historical experiment records,
> not as a supported v0.23 deployment recipe. The synchronous and asynchronous
> v0.23 paths both require matching Ascend hardware validation.

## When to use this connector

The retained implementation describes an asynchronous Ascend NPU prefill path
with the following constraints. These are code-level constraints, not a v0.23
hardware support claim:

- CAM operator packages are installed on every node;
- Attention performs MoE gating before dispatch to FFN ranks;
- execution is eager and AFD async-DP is enabled; **`async=true` is required**;
- the service is the prefill stage of a prefill/decode-disaggregated deployment;
- optional MoE ubatching is managed by AFD as two request-boundary stages.

CAM async currently does not support decode, ACL graph execution, or vLLM
native DBO.

## CAM async data flow

CAM async removes synchronization between data-parallel replicas and avoids the
rank-wide synchronization imposed by dispatch/combine all-to-all communication
at large expert-parallel sizes. When requests are unevenly distributed across
DP replicas, each replica can continue its CAM dispatch/combine work without
waiting for every other replica to reach the same communication point. This
eliminates unnecessary idle time caused by DP request imbalance.

One MoE layer follows this sequence:

1. Attention computes top-k expert IDs and weights.
2. `async_dispatch_send` sends hidden states and routing IDs into the CAM group.
3. Each FFN rank calls `async_dispatch_recv` and receives its routed expert
   tokens, shared-expert tokens, token counts, and optional dynamic-quant scales.
4. The FFN worker executes its local routed and shared experts.
5. `async_combine_send` returns those outputs with the dispatch metadata.
6. Attention calls `async_combine_recv`; CAM routes, weights, and combines the
   expert results for the original tokens.

CAM dispatch payloads carry the token-count and routing metadata. Consequently,
this connector does not use the separate Gloo DP-metadata control plane used by
the synchronous connectors.

## Topology and rank derivation

The connector creates one HCCL world with all Attention ranks first and all FFN
ranks second:

```text
world rank:  0    1   ...  A-1   A    A+1  ...  A+F-1
member:      A0   A1  ...  A_    F0   F1   ...  F_
```

For `A = num_attention_ranks` and `F = num_ffn_ranks`:

- Attention role rank `i` has world rank `i`;
- FFN role rank `j` has world rank `A + j`;
- world size is `A + F`;
- each role rank must be unique and within its role's configured rank count.

Attention ranks are normally `DP x PCP`. `attn_ranks_per_dp` is the PCP width
and is also passed to CAM as its Attention TP width. Before connector
initialization, the connector factory resolves the effective role rank as:

```text
role_rank =
    (global_dp_rank * pcp_size + pcp_rank) * tp_size + tp_rank
```

The role rank is runtime state, not public configuration. vLLM's global DP
rank already includes `data_parallel_start_rank`, and the connector factory
uses one shared resolver before constructing any connector.

The DeepSeek-V3.2 recipe uses `DP3PCP8 + EP8`:

```text
num_attention_ranks = 3 * 8 = 24
num_ffn_ranks = 8
attn_ranks_per_dp = 8

No role-rank field is configured.

Attention node 0, global DP ranks 0..1: effective role ranks 0..15
Attention node 1, global DP rank 2:     effective role ranks 16..23
FFN EP8 process, global DP ranks 0..7:  effective role ranks 0..7

CAM world ranks: A0..A23 = 0..23, F0..F7 = 24..31
```

FFN ranks follow expert parallel placement. The runtime derives experts per rank
from the model routed-expert count and `num_ffn_ranks`; use a model/topology in
which routed experts divide evenly across FFN ranks. All roles must use the same
model, routed-expert layout, quantization, HCCL address, rank counts, CAM
settings, and ubatching settings. In an async deployment, every Attention (A)
and FFN (F) process must also set `--max-num-batched-tokens` to the same value.

## AFD configuration

Pass AFD configuration through vLLM's `--additional-config` under the `afd`
key. The presence of the `afd` object enables AFD; omit it to disable AFD.
There is no separate `--afd-config` option.

```jsonc
{
  "afd": {
    "role": "attention",
    "connector": "CAMAsyncAFDConnector",
    "async": true,
    "host": "10.0.0.1",
    "port": 6239,
    "num_attention_ranks": 24,
    "num_ffn_ranks": 8,
    "compute_gate_on_attention": true,
    "connector_extra_config": {
      "dynamicQuant": 1,
      "attn_ranks_per_dp": 8,
      "async_moe_ubatching": true,
      "async_moe_num_ubatches": 2,
      "async_moe_split": "request"
    }
  }
}
```

### Common fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning and constraint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `role` | `"attention" \| "ffn"` | `"attention"` | Role owned by this process. |
| `connector` | `str` | `"P2pNcclAFDConnector"` | Must be `CAMAsyncAFDConnector`. |
| `async` / `async_dp` | `bool` | `false` | Must be `true`. `async` is the accepted compatibility alias for canonical `async_dp`. |
| `host` | `str` | `"127.0.0.1"` | **Must be the IP address of the node that owns Attention rank 0.** Every rank must use the same reachable value. |
| `port` | `int` | `1239` | HCCL rendezvous port in `1..65535`; it must be free and reachable. |
| `num_attention_ranks` | `int` | `1` | Total Attention ranks, including all DP/PCP-derived ranks. |
| `num_ffn_ranks` | `int` | `1` | Total FFN expert ranks. |
| `compute_gate_on_attention` | `bool` | `false` | Must be `true`; CAM async runs MoE routing on Attention before dispatching to FFN ranks. |
| `connector_extra_config` | `dict` | `{}` | Connector-specific settings. Unknown top-level AFD fields are rejected. |

Compatibility aliases `afd_role`, `afd_connector`, `afd_host`, and `afd_port`
are also accepted. New configurations should use the canonical names shown
above, except `async`, which is retained as the documented compatibility
spelling used by the recipes.

### CAM async `connector_extra_config`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning and constraint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dynamicQuant` | `int` | `0` | Enables CAM dispatch/combine dynamic-quant metadata. Only `0` and `1` are accepted. With `1`, FFN receives quantized routed activations plus scale tensors and must return output compatible with combine-send. |
| `attn_ranks_per_dp` | `int` | `1` | Positive Attention rank count per DP replica, normally the PCP width, passed to CAM as its Attention TP size. Runtime role-rank derivation uses vLLM's DP/PCP/TP placement directly. |
| `async_moe_ubatching` | `bool` | `false` | Enables AFD-managed asynchronous MoE-only ubatching. |
| `async_moe_num_ubatches` | `int` | `2` | Number of asynchronous MoE stages. Only `2` is supported. |
| `async_moe_split` | `str` | `"request"` | Stage split policy. The current async connector supports request-boundary splitting only. |

## Native DBO and async MoE ubatching are different

### vLLM native DBO

Do not pass any of these options to a CAM async process:

```bash
--enable-dbo
--dbo-decode-token-threshold <N>
--dbo-prefill-token-threshold <N>
```

They enable vLLM's native dual-batch overlap/ubatching. Runtime validation
rejects native DBO with `CAMAsyncAFDConnector`; those flags belong to supported
synchronous connector deployments.

### AFD-managed asynchronous MoE ubatching

`async_moe_ubatching` pipelines only the MoE portion of CAM async execution.
Requests are divided at request boundaries into exactly two stages. Each stage
keeps its own pending Attention routing metadata so dispatch and combine remain
paired while Attention and FFN work overlap. It does not enable vLLM native DBO
and does not use the DBO threshold flags.

When `async_moe_ubatching=true`, all roles must set:

```json
{
  "compute_gate_on_attention": true,
  "connector_extra_config": {
    "async_moe_ubatching": true,
    "async_moe_num_ubatches": 2,
    "async_moe_split": "request"
  }
}
```

Decode context parallel size greater than one is also rejected because the
current async MoE metadata path does not support it.

## Requirements

For historical reference, the previous CAM async v0.26 path was verified with:

- Ascend 910C;
- Python 3.12;
- CANN 9.0.1;
- runtime image build `nightly-main-a3-openeuler-20260801230444_aarch64`;
- vLLM v0.26.0 at commit `568afb3a1`;
- vLLM-Ascend branch `releases/v0.26.0rc` at commit `80d8c194f`;
- the included `CAM_ascend910_93_openEuler_aarch64.run` installer;
- `umdk_cam_op_lib-209.0.0b1-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl`.

The nightly image identifier records the validation environment; it is not a
promise of a stable public pull tag. Some development package metadata in that
image still reports a `0.19.1rc2.dev1327` version. The source commits above are
the historical compatibility baseline for that v0.26 validation, not for the
current v0.23 source port.

Install the CAM packages from the repository root inside the container:

```bash
bash afd_plugin/connectors/npu/bin/CAM_ascend910_93_openEuler_aarch64.run
pip install afd_plugin/connectors/npu/bin/umdk_cam_op_lib-209.0.0b1-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl
```

Every CAM async process needs the CAM operator library on its loader path and
the Ascend plugin enabled. The complete recipe includes all tuning variables;
the essential setup is:

```bash
export ASCEND_CUSTOM_OPP_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.0.1/opp/vendors/CAM:${ASCEND_CUSTOM_OPP_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.0.1/opp/vendors/CAM/op_api/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.0.1/opp/vendors/CAM/op_api:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export HCCL_BUFFSIZE=4096
export VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_CONTEXT_PARALLEL=1
export PYTORCH_NPU_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
```

At initialization, the runtime verifies that `torch`, `torch_npu`,
`umdk_cam_op_lib`, and the four real `torch.ops.umdk_cam_op_lib` operators are
available: `async_dispatch_send`, `async_dispatch_recv`,
`async_combine_send`, and `async_combine_recv`.

## Current limitations

- Eager execution only; ACL graph mode is unsupported.
- Prefill stage only in a prefill/decode-disaggregated deployment.
- vLLM native DBO/ubatching is unsupported.
- AFD-managed MoE ubatching supports exactly two request-boundary stages.
- Decode context parallel metadata is unsupported with async MoE ubatching.
- Routed experts should divide evenly across FFN ranks.
- Other Ascend hardware, full unmodified DeepSeek-V3.2, different model
  families, CAM/CANN/container versions, cross-version combinations, and
  topologies other than the recipe should be treated as unverified.
